# ws1001wxdata
Get real-time weather data from Ambient WS-1001 weather station.
*** December 8, 2016

This software is designed to work with the Ambient Weather WS-1001-WIFI
OBSERVER weather station. It produces output data that can be read by
the Cumulus weather station program. I am currently running ws1001wxdata
on my MS Windows 10 PC successfully.

Files:

ws1001wxdata.pl:
This Perl program establishes a TCP connection with the ws1001 console and
obtains the real time weather data generated by the sensor array.
It writes an output file containing the ws1001 weather data in a format
compatible with the cumulus easyweather.dat input file.

msg-udp-srch.dat:
This is the UDP broadcast message.

msg-tcp-nowrec-req.dat:
This is the realtime data request message sent to the ws1001 console.

run_ws1001wxdata.sh:
This is an example shell script.

Software:
ActivePerl (Perl version 5.20.1)
EasyWeather Version 2.3.3
Cumulus release v1.9.4 (build 1099)

Version 1.19:
  Use -m option if console displays wx data in metric units.
  Use -p option to get Pi host address.
  Use -a option to specify and check for wx alarms.
